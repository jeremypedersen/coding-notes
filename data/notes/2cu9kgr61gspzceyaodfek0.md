Some of this is tied to the [[Hardware|ai.optimization.hardware]] section. However we can offer some platform-agnostic general guidance for Hugging Face's Transformers library, as well as TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

Hardware-specific optimizations (such as [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) for NVIDIA GPUs or [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html) for Intel hardware) will be discussed in the Hardware section.
