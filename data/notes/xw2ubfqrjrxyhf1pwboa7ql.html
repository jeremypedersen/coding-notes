<p>There are three core components that are used to build web applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</li>
<li>CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)</li>
<li>JavaScript (in modern times, TypeScript)</li>
</ul>
<p>HTML defines the structure of a web page, by allowing you to "mark up" (tag) text, and create links to other pages or media images, videos. HTML is all about structure: it doesn't provide the ability to <em>style</em> content. </p>
<p>CSS is used to apply styles to HTML. Whereas HTML definese the <em>content</em> and <em>structure</em> of a web page, CSS defines the <em>style</em>. Colors, sizes, fonts and the like are controlled by CSS.</p>
<p>JavaScript provides dynamic functionality. If something on a webpage moves, changes style or position, or otherwise responds to user behavior, that's usually JavaScript at work.</p>
<h2 id="web-standards-how-we-got-html5">Web Standards (how we got HTML5)<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#web-standards-how-we-got-html5"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Pre-1997 there were essentially no standards: browsers could implement HTML any way they wanted</li>
<li>The first widely adopted standards were HTML 4.0 and 4.01, but this was a loose standard.</li>
<li>In 2000, W3C (the standards body responsible for HTML 4) came out with XHTML 1.0, a far more rigid and clear standard.</li>
<li>The major browser vendors thought work on XHTML 1.0 was moving too slow, so in 2004 they created WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Group) to work on their own standard. This is the group that drives the current HTML5 standard.</li>
<li>Between ~2007-2009 W3C and WHATWG started working together on HTML5 with WHATWG. </li>
<li>Essentially, WHATWG owns the "living" implementation of HTML5, and W3C owns the standard "fixed" specification of that standard. More <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2019/w3c-and-whatwg-to-work-together-to-advance-the-open-web-platform/">here</a>.</li>
