<p>This section contains concrete, self-contained demonstrations intended to show how models are trained, fine-tuned, and deployed. These will be toy applications, with the primary focus on the models themselves rather than on practical applications. </p>
<p>The <strong>goal</strong> will be to provide the apps in a form that is <strong>easy to run</strong> and requires <strong>minimal manual setup</strong>. </p>
<p>Apps should be built in a way that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enables easy updating even by non-expert users. </li>
<li>Is robust against changes in library or language versions (especially for Python apps).</li>
</ol>
