<p>Some of this is tied to the <a href="/coding-notes/notes/5bixl6kw3cmj3ec9zuvxi1e">Hardware</a> section. However we can offer some platform-agnostic general guidance for Hugging Face's Transformers library, as well as TensorFlow and PyTorch. </p>
<p>Hardware-specific optimizations (such as <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit">CUDA</a> for NVIDIA GPUs or <a href="https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/index.html">OpenVINO</a> for Intel hardware) will be discussed in the Hardware section.</p>
