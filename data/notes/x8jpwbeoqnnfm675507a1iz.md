# Demo Apps

This section contains concrete, self-contained demonstrations intended to show how models are trained, fine-tuned, and deployed. These will be toy applications, with the primary focus on the models themselves rather than on practical applications. 

The **goal** will be to provide the apps in a form that is **easy to run** and requires **minimal manual setup**. 

Apps should be built in a way that either:

1. Enables easy updating even by non-expert users. 
2. Is robust against changes in library or language versions (especially for Python apps).
