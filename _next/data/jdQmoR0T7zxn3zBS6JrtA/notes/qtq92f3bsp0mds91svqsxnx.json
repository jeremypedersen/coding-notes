Look no further! Growing tomatoes from seed is a rewarding and fun experience that anyone can enjoy, even if you're new to gardening. 🌱\n\nHere's a simple step-by-step guide to get you started:\n\n1. Choose your tomato seeds. There are many varieties available, so pick one that suits your taste and growing conditions. 🍅\n2. Fill small pots or seed trays with a well-draining seed starting mix.\n3. Plant the seeds about 1/4 inch deep and gently cover them with soil.\n4. Water the soil until it's moist but not soggy, and place the pots in a warm, sunny spot or under grow lights. ☀️\n5. Keep the soil moist and wait for the seeds to germinate, which usually takes 7-14 days.\n6. Once the seedlings have grown a few inches tall and have their first set of true leaves, transplant them into larger pots.\n7. Continue caring for your tomato plants by watering them regularly, providing plenty of light, and fertilizing them every few weeks. 💧\n\nNot only will you enjoy delicious, homegrown tomatoes, but you'll also reap the many health benefits of gardening! Studies show that gardening can reduce stress, improve mental health, and provide gentle physical activity. 💪😊\n\nPlus, by growing your own food, you'll know exactly what goes into it and can enjoy the freshest, most flavorful tomatoes possible. 🍽️\n\nSo why not give indoor tomato gardening a try? Share your experiences and photos in the comments below, and let's inspire each other to cultivate a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle! 🌍💚\n\n#IndoorGardening #TomatoesFromSeed #HealthyLiving #SustainableLiving #GardeningForBeginners\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the model provided the emojis, engaging title, and hashtags all on its own. Compare that to the output below, which was generated from the barebones prompt <code>Create a facebook post about growing tomato plants indoors</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>🍅🌿 Attention all gardening enthusiasts! 🌱\n\nHave you ever wanted to enjoy fresh, juicy tomatoes year-round? Well, I've got great news for you! Growing tomatoes indoors is easier than you might think, and it's a fantastic way to have a constant supply of this delicious fruit. 🍅\n\nHere are a few tips to get you started:\n\n1. Choose the right variety: Opt for smaller, compact tomato plants that are well-suited for indoor growth, such as cherry or plum tomatoes. 🍒\n\n2. Provide plenty of light: Tomatoes need at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. If you don't have a sunny window, consider using grow lights to ensure your plants receive enough light. ☀️💡\n\n3. Maintain the right temperature: Tomatoes thrive in temperatures between 65-85°F (18-29°C). Keep them away from cold drafts and air conditioning vents. 🌡️\n\n4. Water and fertilize regularly: Keep the soil consistently moist but not soggy, and fertilize your plants every two weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. 💦🌿\n\n5. Support your plants: As your tomato plants grow, provide them with a stake, cage, or trellis for support. This will keep the fruits off the ground and improve air circulation. 🪴\n\nGrowing tomatoes indoors is a rewarding experience that allows you to enjoy fresh, homegrown produce no matter the season! 🥗 If you have any tips or success stories about indoor tomato gardening, share them in the comments below! 👇\n\nHappy gardening, everyone! 🌿😊\n\n#IndoorGardening #TomatoPlants #GrowYourOwn #GardeningTips #FreshProduce\n</code></pre>\n<p>Still OK, but note that the prompt does not include specific, targeted information about physical and psychological benefits of gardening, and the instructions are not beginner friendly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approaches-to-prompting\">Approaches to prompting<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#approaches-to-prompting\"></a></h2>\n<p>Beyond ensuring the prompt includes enough detail (by using a framework like CO-STAR), there are also some approaches to prompting that can give the LLM additional context about what we want it to do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zero-shot-prompting\">Zero-shot prompting<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#zero-shot-prompting\"></a></h3>\n<p>A zero-shot prompt does not include any examples of the required response.
