Looks like it can do a ton of cool stuff but I'm mostly interested in the ability to do mesh reconstruction (to make 3D models).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.di.ens.fr/pmvs/\">PMVS (Patch-based Multi-vew Stereo)</a>, a tool for doing the 3D reconstruction from a set of images.

Good enough to <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3678651/Animal-avengers-rescue-Adorable-puppy-eat-3D-printed-tooth-replaces-one-broke-chewing.html\">print replacement teeth for dogs</a>, at least.</p>\n<p>They looked at a couple different solutions and chose openMVS + openMVG as their general favorite.</p>\n<p>It looks like for simple 3D reconstructions from a set of photographs Meshlab may also work (not tested in their blog).</p>\n<p>As for <strong>sharing the resulting models</strong> it seems <a href=\"https://www.thingiverse.com/\">Thingiverse</a> is the go-to for 3D printing, and <a href=\"https://sketchfab.com\">Sketchfab</a> for general 3D models.  </p>\n<p>Apparently <a href=\"https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes\">Three.js</a> can also display reconstructions, up to and including animation! </p>\n<h2 id=\"panoramas\">Panoramas<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#panoramas\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://hugin.sourceforge.io/\">Hugin</a>, which appears to be the leading open source toolkit for making panoramic images, and is based on <a href=\"https://panotools.sourceforge.net/\">Panorama tools</a>. Both seem to be working just fine but are quite old and seem to mostly just be receiving maintenance updates. The releases on the Hugin site indicate that no major new features are being added, but the software is being actively maintained.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://krupkat.github.io/xpano/\">Xpano</a> looks like a simpler alternative to Hugin, will autodetect related images in a folder, stitch them, and export.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"aiml-stuff\">AI/ML Stuff<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#aiml-stuff\"></a></h2>\n<p>There are some really, really cool demos that mix photography and generative AI.
